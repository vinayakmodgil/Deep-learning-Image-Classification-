## Final Project Submission

## Pneumonia Detection

## Overview: 
This project uses Convolutional Neural Network to detect pneumonia from normal and infected images.

## Business Problem
Pneumonia is an inflammatory disease caused by infection with viruses or bacteria in the lungs. It affects about 445 million (7% of the total population) and results in about 4.3 million deaths. Pneumonia can be treated if diagnosed during the early onset, otherwise it can be extremely lethal.

## Data 
Data of nearly 5500 images is given either normal or having pneumonia.

## Methods
I use CNN to detect whether an X-ray image is normal or infected and predict the accuracy of the model created to detect pneumonia.

## Results
Training accuracy of the best model
